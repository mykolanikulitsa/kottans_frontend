Hello World!

Nice to see you here.

1. First I want to tell few words about: "How to use Git and GitHub" course. It took a long time to finish it. And do you know why? It was my first course about Git and Github and I've outlined all the course to my notebook. The course is very impressive. Carolyn and Sarah did a hard work. They chew on literally everything. Thanks.
2. try.github.io - gave me more tips, advices, tricks about using git. 
Now I'm starting http://gitreal.codeschool.com. Its very interesting.
3. Git tips - is a very good resourse where I will learn more and more about Git.
Using a new tool can cause a bit of a headache in the first few days. The only way to get through this learning curve is to keep going. In this article a lot of good staff, but Udacity gave me a good ground. I like Typing club very much it will help me very much). Im sure that sourcetree is a very useful thing. To make work easier. Sourcetree) Use a Git GUI. 
4. learngitbranching - is a very powerfull tutorial. I like It. There is a lot of new commands for me. But i think when you start using GiT GUI you make your life easier.
5. Learn anything front-end - Its a front-end road map to become a confident front-end developer.
There is a lot of new things for me. Im starting explore Its now.Its Perfect. There is so much information to explore. Thank you.
6. Linux Command Line Basics. It's an interesting course with funny guys)
I have some troubles there with installing a VM but Google help me with that and I've done it well. I like that they give a good sequence of learning materials. I heard somethings about VM but farther I'll use it often. https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud595
7. Configuring Linux Web Servers is more powerfull course. It is really hard to keep all that new staff in your mind. I've wrote down all that course in to my notebook.)) Good thing is that I remember to keep update all the staff you work on in order not to alter. I've learnt a couple dozen new commands. How to protect new user and what for. About default ports. First steps in using firewalls and how to activate it. And first steps in using web-servers. Thanks. https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud299
8. Networking for Web Developers. Interesting and Informative course about servers, addresses, networks, HTTP and TCP. A lot of examples and illustrations about how does it work. How the internet works. How we can check everything what we need or what we want. Thanks!

9. I got a lot of theory from the two parts of the HTTP-protocol. Pavan Podila gives a fundamental understanding of the protocol and its accompanying components. I recognized the infrastructure on the server side. Went deeper into the HTTP-protocol. I understand what GET and POST are and also other verbs of queries.
Repeat the mother of learning! I also got an idea about the processing of connections, identification and authentication. I understand what caching is, what kinds and meanings there are. This study of the protocol does not end here, since references are given for its further study. Great articles!
10. “What is the version control” is a very helpful course! Dive deeper into version control system. More tips, hacks, tricks. I’ve like the info about commit messages – very useful. Good advice is that if you working in team, company - use their existing style(commit messages, css, html – I knew about that). This course had a ton of useful information! I like the last lesson about undoing changes. I got new tricks to save time during the work. Practice, Practice, Practice!
Step-by-step.
