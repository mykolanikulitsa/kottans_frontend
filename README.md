Hello World!

Nice to see you here.

1. First I want to tell few words about: "How to use Git and GitHub" course. It took a long time to finish it. And do you know why? It was my first course about Git and Github and I've outlined all the course to my notebook. The course is very impressive. Carolyn and Sarah did a hard work. They chew on literally everything. Thanks.
2. try.github.io - gave me more tips, advices, tricks about using git. 
Now I'm starting http://gitreal.codeschool.com. Its very interesting.
3. Git tips - is a very good resourse where I will learn more and more about Git.
Using a new tool can cause a bit of a headache in the first few days. The only way to get through this learning curve is to keep going. In this article a lot of good staff, but Udacity gave me a good ground. I like Typing club very much it will help me very much). Im sure that sourcetree is a very useful thing. To make work easier. Sourcetree) Use a Git GUI. 
4. learngitbranching - is a very powerfull tutorial. I like It. There is a lot of new commands for me. But i think when you start using GiT GUI you make your life easier.
5. Learn anything front-end - Its a front-end road map to become a confident front-end developer.
